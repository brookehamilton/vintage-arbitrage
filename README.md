## New Project -- Work In Progress

Which of those dusty old books, action figures, or vintage dolls is highly valuable?

The aim of this project is to build a suite of tools that can automatically detect valuable vintage objects hiding in plain sight in places like online auctions, thrift stores, and flea markets.
