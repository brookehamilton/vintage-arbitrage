## New Project -- Work In Progress

Which of those creepy old dolls, dusty action figures, or antique books is highly valuable?

The aim of this project is to build a suite of tools that can automatically detect valuable vintage objects hiding in plain sight in places like online auctions, thrift stores, and flea markets.
